# Do Items Order? Analysis with Shift-Scale IRT Models

Manuscript by Julia Haaf, Edgar Merkle, and Jeff Rouder.

Item ordering refers to the statement that if one item is harder than another for one person, then it is harder for all people. Whether item ordering holds or not is a psychological statement because it describes how people may qualitatively vary. Yet, modern item response theory (IRT) makes an a priori commitment to item ordering, such as in the Rasch model where items have
to order, or, conversely, in the 2PL model, where items cannot order. Needed is an IRT model where item ordering or its violation is a function of the data rather than an a priori commitment. We develop a two-parameter shifted-exponential model for this purpose. We show how item ordering may be assessed and discuss computational issues with shift-scale IRT models.
